# Resource Limits

Resource limits, also known as rlimits or ulimits, configure the maximum resources a
process and its children can consume, and persist accross execs.

Limits can be set on a number of dimensions including: virtual memory size (`RLIMIT_AS`),
data segement size (`RLIMIT_DATA`), stack size (`RLIMIT_STACK`), CPU time (`RLIMIT_CPU`),
and core dump file size (`RLIMIT_CORE`).

Hitting a limit manifests itself in different ways: Setting `RLIMIT_CORE` to 0 means core
dump files aren't created, hitting `RLIMIT_CPU` triggers a `SIGXCPU`, and hitting a memory
limit leads to allocator errors.

Resource limits should be read and written via the `ulimit` bash builtin, `prlimit`,
`/proc/PID/limits`, or `prlimit64(2)` (which replaced previous system calls).

`CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` is required to make changes to hard limits, but soft limits may be
changed by unprivledged processes (within the bounds of the hard limits).
