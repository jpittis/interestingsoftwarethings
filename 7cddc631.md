# HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is HTTP/1 but more efficient. The protocol unit is a "frame" (frame types include
HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, etc.). Requests are represented as "streams" which are
multiplexed over a single connection. It supports flow-control, prioritization and header
compression (via HPACK).

HTTP/1.0 requires many connections because it allows only 1 outstanding request per
connection. HTTP/1.1 pipelining isn't much better because it suffers from head-of-line
blocking. Also, expensive connection establishment is often required for a new requests.
All of this leads to bad network utilization.

HTTP/2 addresses this by multiplexing many requests over a single connection.  This allows
for less, longer lived connections and less frequent connection establishment.
Additionally, it adds header compression because headers are verbose. It's binary message
framing is also more efficient. All of this leads to better network utilization.
